Pyganim
=======

This repo is a fork of: https://github.com/asweigart/pyganim

This version of Pyganim is a PEP8-compliant version, and I've adjusted the Pyganim code to work. The version in the official repo breaks if you try to use get_images_from_sprite_sheet() or if you try to use the sprite copy() function. Potentially more things can break on the way, but I've only tested those.

Original code from Al Sweigart.
